# we declare a class by using the `class` keyword
# class names follow CapitalCamelCase convention
# we usually put one class in a file, you're able to put multiple classes in a file
# but generally speaking, it's preferred to put one class in each file.
# file names for classes follow snake_case convetion of the same class name
# so if my class name is StreetCar then the file name should be: street_car.rb
# c = Cookie.new
# c is an object (also called instance) or the Cookie class
class Cookie

    # this defines a `class` method which you call on the class directly and not on
    # an instance (or object) of the class so:
    # Cookie.info # will work
    # Cookie.new.info # will give an error
    # you can also define it as: def Cookie.info

    # c = Cookie.new
    # c.eat
    # if you try to call it directly on the class you will get an error as in:
    # Cookie.eat
    # public method means that we can call it from outside of methods in this class
    # so I can use this method in other classes or in `pry` for instance
